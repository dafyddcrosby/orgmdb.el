* orgmdb.el

I keep my watchlist in org-mode and this package makes metadata retrieving pretty easy through OMDb. The package is quite immature, I just copied functions from my Emacs config and called it a package.

** Installing
Download the =orgmdb.el= and put it into your load path, then you can use it by =(require 'orgmdb)=.

Another option is to use =use-package= and =quelpa=:
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package orgmdb
    :ensure t
    :quelpa (orgmdb
             :fetcher github
             :repo "isamert/orgmdb.el"))
#+end_src

** Demo
[[file:./orgmdb.gif]]

** Usage
You need get yourself an API key to be able to use this package, see [[https://omdbapi.com/][OMDb website]]. After getting yourself an API key, you can start using.

#+begin_src elisp
  (setq orgmdb-omdb-apikey "YOUR-API-KEY")
  (let ((movie (orgmdb :title "in the mood for love")))
    (format "Movie name: %s, Year: %s, Plot: %s"
            (orgmdb-title movie)
            (orgmdb-year movie)
            (orgmdb-plot movie)))
#+end_src

Another example:
#+begin_src elisp
  (orgmdb :title "thinking of ending things" :year 2020)

  ;; This returns something like this:
  ((Title . "I'm Thinking of Ending Things")
   (Year . "2020")
   (Rated . "R")
   (Released . "04 Sep 2020")
   (Runtime . "134 min")
   (Genre . "Drama, Thriller")
   (Director . "Charlie Kaufman")
   (Writer . "Charlie Kaufman (written for the screen by), Iain Reid (based on the book by)")
   (Actors . "Jesse Plemons, Jessie Buckley, Toni Collette, David Thewlis") (Plot . "Full of misgivings, a young woman travels with her new boyfriend to his parents' secluded farm. Upon arriving, she comes to question everything she thought she knew about him, and herself.")
   (Language . "English, Spanish")
   (Country . "USA") ...)
#+end_src

There are also some other interactive functions that you can use, for example:

- =orgmdb-movie-properties= :: Show all properties of a movie in a cute little org-mode buffer with a small poster. If you call this function on a org header, it'll search for header title in the OMDb. See the following gif:
- =orgmdb-fill-movie-properties= :: Set preselected selected list of properties (see =orgmdb-fill-property-list=) to current org header.
